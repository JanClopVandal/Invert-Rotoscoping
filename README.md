VR installation. 
The installation presents a VR journey inside the compost. 
The title is a pun that combines the words “rot” and “scope”. 
Here, the compost pit is seen as a dystopian dump and the quin tessence of the fact that nature can adapt and  remain, 
but a man may no longer be able to survive in new circumstances. 
This experience is a clear commentary on the state of our planet, or at least on our deteriorating in uence on it.
